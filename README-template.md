## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### Continued development

I wanted to try and improve my learnings about SASS style at this project. Overall, i think there is room to improve as there are tools provided by SASS that was not used. Futhermore, this project made me realize that align elements can be hard as i couldn't match some elements and i should be focusing on learning more CSS properties.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools Modal Example](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp) - This example helped me build the menu modal on mobile.
